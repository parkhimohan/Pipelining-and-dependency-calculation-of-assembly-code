# Pipelining-and-dependency-calculation-of-assembly-code
In computer organisation, implementation of pipelining is done to optimise performance both with and without bypassing, but it has to be done carefully so as to not disturb an ongoing process or change its outcome.
This process takes an assembly code (randomCode.asm) file's instructions as input and outputs the dependencies present. The code for this has been written in python (in file Pipelining-DependencyCalculationOfAssemblyCode.py)
